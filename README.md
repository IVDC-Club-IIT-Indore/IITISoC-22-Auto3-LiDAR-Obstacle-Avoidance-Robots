**Description:** Large Warehouses (such as those of Amazon) are
highly dynamic environments with many moving objects.
Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) with 3D LiDARs and other
sensors are deployed to move goods around the warehouse for
efficient material movement in a robust and fast manner.
Since there are also people working around, these advanced
robots have to perceive the environment, make intelligent
decisions and make judgments of static and dynamic obstacles
(or other robots) around it to avoid collisions and hazards.
LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance and dynamic tracking systems
must be deployed with a robust decision-making architecture.

**Specifications:**
-  Any 3D LiDAR may be used (_Ouster OS_ series or _Velodyne
Puck_).
- Assume the robots are slow-moving.
- A C++ based collision avoidance and planning module is
preferred for such high-speed and high-accuracy tasks.
- A few scenarios may be simulated with the developed
software stack.
